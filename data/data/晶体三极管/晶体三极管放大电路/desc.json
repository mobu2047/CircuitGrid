    "detailed": "A single DC power supply VCC powers both the transistor's input and output stages. The input stage uses RB1 and RB2 as a voltage divider to provide base bias voltage V_BB, while the output stage consists of VCC and RC. The input circuit is simplified using Thévenin's theorem to an equivalent voltage source V_BB and equivalent resistance RB, enabling calculation of base current IB, collector current IC, and collector-emitter voltage VCE to verify transistor operation in active mode."
